title: Bron Cena Weak Aura
description: Plays John Cena's theme when Bron appears
---

When a wild Bron appears, the John Cena theme tune will play.

You don't have to be Kyrian to use this Weak Aura! When someone near you summons Bron, the theme will play.

## Setup

1. Close World of Warcraft
1. [Download broncena-intro.ogg](https://github.com/SadRobotGG/Auras/raw/main/BronCena/sounds/broncena-intro.ogg)
1. Place `broncena-intro.gg` in `C:\Games\World of Warcraft\_retail_\CustomSounds`.
   You must create the CustomSounds folder if it doesn't exist yet.
1. Launch World of Warcraft
1. Import the WeakAura

## FAQ

### Q: I see the text when Bron appears, but I hear no sound

1. Did you download the broncena-intro.ogg file and place it in the correct location?
1. Have you restarted the WoW client to detect the new audio file?
1. The music will play on the Dialog channel. In your sound settings in WoW, is your Dialog channel too low?
