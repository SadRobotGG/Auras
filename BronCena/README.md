title: Bron Cena Weak Aura
description: Plays John Cena's theme when Bron appears
---

When a wild Bron appears, the John Cena theme tune will play.

You don't have to be Kyrian to use this Weak Aura! When someone near you summons Bron, the theme will play.

## Setup

[Download broncena-intro.ogg](https://github.com/SadRobotGG/Auras/raw/main/BronCena/sounds/broncena-intro.ogg) and place in `C:\Games\World of Warcraft\_retail_\CustomSounds` (or wherever you have WoW installed).

> If WoW is running, you must **restart the game client** for it to recognize the new sound file!

## FAQ

### Q: I see the text when Bron appears, but hear no sound

1. Did you download the broncena-intro.ogg file and place it in the correct location?
1. Have you restarted the WoW client to detect the new audio file?
