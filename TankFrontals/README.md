# Tank Frontals

Announces in `/say` for tank frontals that the group must look out for, as well as important dispels / purges / soothes.

This helps group members avoid damage and potential deaths when it may be unclear where the tank is standing and pointing the mobs, amongst nameplates, visual effects and markers.

In the Custom Options tab, you can customize the announce messages, and which spells to enable / disable for announce.

In the Actions tab, you can toggle enabling or disabling the chat message, and customize the Sound (defaults 'Front' from the [WA Soundpack](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/sharedmedia_causese))

- **FRONTAL** - This is a cleave and the tank must take the hit and not point at the group.
- **SHOCKWAVE** - This is a frontal or projectile that is aimed at the tank, but the tank can also dodge it once it has been baited.
- **KNOCKBACK** - This frontal will also knock back anyone it hits.
- **SLAM** - This is an AoE targeted on the tank, even if they're moving away.
- **SOOTHE** - An enrage effect that should be dispelled by a soothe / purge ability.
- **PURGE** - Another beneficial magic effect that should be purged.
- **STACK** - Multiple players need to stack on the tank to split damage.

## Supported encounters

- The War Within Season 1

## Known Issues / FAQ

- You'll get announcements for SOOTHE and PURGE even if there might be people in your group that can do none of these things. I might look into fixing this, but not at the cost of performance.
