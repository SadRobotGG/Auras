Announces in "/say" for tank frontals, slams and shockwaves that the group must look out for.

This helps group members avoid damage and potential deaths when it may be unclear where the tank is standing and pointing the mobs, amongst nameplates, visual effects and markers.

Also calls out soothe and purge for several important casts.

In the Custom Options tab, you can customize the announce messages, and which spells to enable / disable for announce.
